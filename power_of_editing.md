## Power Editing (Text Editor and text manipulation)

Programmers manipulate text the same way woodworkers
shape wood.

The daily tools that we use shall be a flawless extension of our hands.\
In that sense we shall pick a powerful editor and learn it, quite often IDE \
are designed to be good at compiling but not at handling text.

Text editor expectation:
 - Configurable All aspects shall be configurable , color window size, key strokes

 - Extensible , plugins can be added to the text editor (e.g autocomplete, advance
 search, git blame ...etc)

- Programable : be able to perform complext multitask, this can be done with
macros
#### Do I need to change or even use a text editor instead of the IDE?
 - As long as you are happy and productive, go for it! BUT if you find yourself
 struggling with your current editor, you may need to reevaluate your position.
